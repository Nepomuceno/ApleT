# ApleT

The ApleT framework is a toolchain for doing agile product line engineering
utilising behaviour-driven development.

Software product line engineering (SPLE) provides an effi-
cient means to produce software that is delivered to multiple
customers, in bespoke form, derived from a composable,
reusable set of assets. Effective use of SPLE can
reduce defects, costs, and time to market by a factor of 10
or more. SPLE is desirable in small- to medium-sized
enterprises, where a common occurrence is the introduction
of a one-off product that proves to be popular, and over time
requires multiple customer-specific versions. However,
in its more traditional form (the *proactive* approach, with a
focus on the long-term up-front domain engineering phase),
SPLE is not always viable for SMEs. Agile product
line engineering (APLE), the combination of SPLE and agile
software development, is a *reactive* approach to facilitating
SPLE in SMEs that can cut down the long-term investment
of the domain engineering phase.

Behaviour-driven development (BDD) is an agile software
development methodology focused on specifying and testing
software through business-focused examples. Through incorporating
the concept of *variability management*, a core tenet of
SPLE, into behaviour-driven development, ApleT
provides an agile approach to product lines that provides automated,
specification-based regression testing across the entire product
line. This approach enables the safe evolution of product lines
both in terms of requirements and in terms of architecture that avoids 
big design up front.
